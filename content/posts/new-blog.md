## Creating a new blog

It was almost needlessly obtuse to try and figure out how to get a blog up and running on Github. I could have used Wordpress or Substack, but I decided to try and be some know-it-all and go for the road less travelled which is to use a CMS called Hugo.

I'd not heard of Hugo until today. But I decided to use it because I could use markdown as a way to write stuff and I'd been singing its praises day in and day out and because of that I had to put my money where my mouth is and actually use markdown in a day to day manner that can showcase its uses and hopefully its flexibility as a content writing system.
