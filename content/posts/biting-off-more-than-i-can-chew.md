# Creating a new blog

It was almost needlessly obtuse to try and figure out how to get a blog up and running on Github. I could have used Wordpress or Substack, but I decided to try and be some know-it-all and go for the road less travelled which is to use a CMS called Hugo.

I'd not heard of Hugo until today. But I decided to use it because I could use Markdown as a way to write stuff and I'd been singing its praises day in and day out and because of that I had to put my money where my mouth is and actually use Markdown in a day to day manner that can showcase its uses and hopefully its flexibility as a content writing system.

But if we were to zoom out a little and take a wider view of the landscape. I don't think that the problem with adopting something like Markdown is due to the way of writing itself (although memorizing a bunch of new commands to get the stylization that you need does take some time to get used to) since we see it's adoption in platforms like Whatsapp and Discord. I think it's just a matter of overcoming the mindshare that Google and Microsoft (and a smaller portion to Apple) have in word processing.

However, as someone who uses word processing programs day in and day out. The fact that they've become so bloated and some requiring constant internet connection to use have made them very annoying to use. Imaging being a skilled basketball player that dribbles a ball up and down the court, at a certain point can do it without even looking at their hands even once and be confident that when they palm the ball to shoot the ball it'll be in their hands. Now what if I told you to play on an uneven surface that may or may not launch your ball off into some random corner if you bounce off the floor wrongly. That's how it feels to write on the online versions of Microsoft Word or Google Docs. The response is just so slow and laggy that you just lose all confidence in being able to type quickly or accurately.

Yes, I hear some of you. It's the fact that people are able to work on a document collaboratively that is the draw of using online word processors. While I can't dispute that specific benefit of using them, but I would argue that a group of people shouldn't be editing a single file unless it's like some group note taking word file. It is possible to collaborate while using Markdown but it's not obvious to me at the moment which program would allow users to do so.

Anyways, I'll try to write a much better summary of why Markdown is better for writing in the future. This is more of a proof-of-concept than an actual written article.
